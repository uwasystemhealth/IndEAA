5. A review is divided into 4 stages: "Overview & Eoc", "Read Documents", "Review Course" and "Review & Submit", it is not necessary that you do these in order, however, once you submit you will lose the ability to edit your review.
6. During the first stage, "Overview & Eoc", you are expected to familiarise yourself with the different element of competencies (EOCs) for this course, you can view the descriptions of each EOC by expanding the dropdowns and then selecting the specific EOC you wish to view.

To keep track of documents you have already viewed, you can click the "Mark as viewed" button. Once you've looked through the document, clicking the "Add Comment" button will allow you to enter a written comment for the document.
9. Click the "Next" button to proceed to the third stage, "Review Course".
10. The "Review Course" stage is where you will complete your actual review of the course. You are expected to provide a comment, rating and ideas for improvement for each EOC. To begin your review of a particular EOC, you should click on the "View" button for the EOC you're interested in.
11. After clicking "View" you should see a window pop up with different information corresponding to the EOC and some fields you are able to fill in.
