# Data Engineering
This covers the section all about data in the system: how it flows from and out of the system to the users, and how the data is stored. This dictates fundamentally how the system would work.

See diagram below for [illustration](/developer/data_engineering/#diagram).

## Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
This illustrates the processes within the system and how data is converted from one form to another, as well as which data store a data will be located in..

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
This illustrates how the data is structured with relation to one another.
